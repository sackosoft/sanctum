# Sanctum

Welcome, sorcerer, to the Sanctum. Write spells in Lua, JavaScript, or WebAssembly to transform event streams of magical energy.

## What is Sanctum?

Sanctum is a platform that enables sorcerers to craft powerful spells that process and transform event streams. Sorcerers
focus on writing spells in their preferred language, while Sanctum handles the complexities of event storage, state and routing
these energies across the ethereal planes.

For more detailed reference information and documentation, refer to the [`docunomicon`](./docunomicon).
